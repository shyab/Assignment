<h3><font color="Grey">Desktop</font></h3>
<p><b>The desktop is the main screen area that you see after you turn on your computer and log on to Windows.</b> Like the top of an actual desk, it serves as a surface for your work. When you open programs or folders, they appear on the desktop. You can also put things on the desktop, such as files and folders, and arrange them however you want.

<h3><font color="blue">Startmenu</font></h3>
<p>The Start menu is the main gateway to your computer's programs, folders, and settings.<u>It's called a menu because it provides a list of choices, just as a restaurant menu does.</u> And as "start" implies, it's often the place that you'll go to start or open things.10<sup>xlog</sup>

<h3><font color="green">Programs</font></h3>
<p>Almost everything you do on your computer requires using a program.For example if you want to draw a picture, you need to use a drawing or painting program To write a letter, you use a word processing program.

<h3><font color="black"></font>Computer</h3>
<p>If you use a desktop computer, you might already know that there isn't any single part called the<sub> "computer."</sub> A computer is really a system of many parts working together. The physical parts, which you can see and touch, are collectively called hardware.
