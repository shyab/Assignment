	<h4>Keyboard</h4>
	<p>Windows Basics topics are designed to introduce you to personal computing and the Windows operating system. Whether you're a beginning computer user or someone with experience using a previous version of Windows, these topics will help you understand the tasks and tools you need to use your computer successfully</p>

	<h4>Mouse</h4>
	<p>Just as you would use your hands to interact with objects in the physical world, you can use your mouse to interact with items on your computer screen. You can move objects, open them, change them, throw them away, and perform other actions, all by pointing and clicking with your mouse.</p>

		<li>RAM</li>
	</ul>

	<h4>Motherboard</h4>
	<p>You can install most hardware or mobile devices just by plugging them into your computer. Windows will automatically install the appropriate driver if it's available. If it's not, Windows will prompt you to insert a software disc that may have come with your hardware device.</p>
	<h4>RAM</h4>
	<p>Memory, such as random access memory (RAM), is temporary storage space that your computer uses to run Windows and other programs. Memory is different from disk space, which is the amount of storage space available on your computer's hard disk.Different computers and programs have different RAM requirements. To learn how to install more RAM, check the information that came with your computer or go to the manufacturer's website</p>

	</ul>

	<h4>Xbox</h4>
	<p>The more RAM your computer has, the faster your programs will generally run. If a lack of RAM is slowing your computer, you might be tempted to increase virtual memory to compensate. However, your computer can read data from RAM much more quickly than from a hard disk, so adding RAM is a better solution.</p>

	<h4>Playstation</h4>
	<p>If you receive error messages that warn of low virtual memory, you need to either add more RAM or increase the size of your paging file so that you can run the programs on your computer. Windows usually manages this automatically, but you can manually change the size of virtual memory if the default size isn't large enough for your needs. For more information, see Change the size of virtual memory.</p>
